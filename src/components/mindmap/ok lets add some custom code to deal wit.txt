ok lets add some custom code to deal with llm content generation.  we might need to update the prompt too... when we ask to create a character etc we should always create a name. we want to try to track this after the character is saved.  meaning if thellm detects this is a character request it should after creating a chacater it should ask if we want to save this character to the story.  This would do a few things.  (right now lets just use an internal json structure to save this data) It would add the character to the mind map (and create a characters top level entry) we will use cytoscan to create these nodes.  we then would have a character node (lets say bob) that would be clickable.
